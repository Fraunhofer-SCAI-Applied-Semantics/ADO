We created Alzheimer's Disease Ontology for TextMining purpose.

## Development
- InputFiles
    - contains OntoFox input files
    - manually created
- OutputModules
    - contains OntoFox output files
    - automatically generated
- ADO.owl
    - main devlopement file, imports module
    - manually created
- catalog-v001.xml
     - Protege catalog file that links IRIs from imported modules to relative file paths
     - manually created
- ADO_merged.owl
    - most recent release (merged main devlopement file with all imported modules)
    - automatically generated
